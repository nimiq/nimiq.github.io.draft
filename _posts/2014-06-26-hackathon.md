Thanks to the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility - INCF](http://www.incf.org/),
which is the organization behind [NeuroStars]({{ site.baseurl }}/neurostars/), I took part in
[Brainhack](http://brainhack.org/hackathon2014/).

*Brainhack* is a 3-day hackathon, held this year in Berlin, Germany in the period June 5-7, 2014.
*Roman* and I have been promoting *NeuroStars* and discussing the idea of integrating a
[semantic backend](http://brainhack.org/neurostars-org/).

Those 3 days gave me a deep look inside the neuroinformatics community: I meet smart interesting
people and saw crazy projects like <http://brainhack.org/pixel-shader-livecoding/>.
