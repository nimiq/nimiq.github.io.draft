[NeuroStars]({{ site.baseurl }}/neurostars/), the project I am working on for
[GSoC2014](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1), is powered by
[BioStar](https://github.com/ialbert/biostar-central).

*BioStar* is a simple, generic, flexible and extensible Q&A framework, written in Python and
Django. *BioStar* is the engine used by some scientific Q&A website: the most popular is
the one in use by the bioinformatics scientific community, available at <https://www.biostars.org>.

We thought it is a good idea to
[ask that community for feedback](https://www.biostars.org/p/99956/), in order to get a list of
what the most-wanted usability improvements are.
