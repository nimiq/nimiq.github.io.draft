We decided to organize our collaborative workflow for [NeuroStars]({{ site.baseurl }}/neurostars/)
during [GSoC2014](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1) using GitHub and following
the [git-flow process](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
The following is an overview of the strategy.

# Repositories

- BioStar codebase: [ialbert/biostar-central](https://github.com/ialbert/biostar-central)
- NeuroStars [INCF](http://www.incf.org/) codebase: [INCF/biostar-central](https://github.com/INCF/biostar-central)
- My codebase: [nimiq/biostar-central](https://github.com/nimiq/biostar-central)


# Development Process

For each new feature I will create a new branch off the `develop` branch in my repository.

Naming convention: anything except `master`, `develop`, `release-*`, or `hotfix-*`. E.g. `api`, `new-deployment`.

When the feature is complete, I will merge back to `develop` and open a pull request to INCF's repository.

# Branches

- `master`: the code deployed to [live](http://neurostars.org).   
Temporary this branch matches ialbert/master. We need to migrate our current live code
(branch `neurostars.org`) to Biostar2 and move the result to this `master` branch.
- `develop`: the latest delivered development changes for the next release.  
Each new feature branch will be based on this.
- `api`: a feature branch I'm currently working on to develop API.
- `new-deployment`: a feature branch meant for the new deployment strategy based on Docker.
It currently contains some work we have done with Vagrant and Docker.
- `biostar1`: the old Biostar1 codebase.

## Temporary branches

- `dev`: old branch, to be removed.
- `old-develop`: old branch, to be removed.
- `neurostars.org`: the code currently running on [live](http://neurostars.org).  
We need to migrate this code to Biostar2, merge it to `master` and `develop`, then delete this branch.
