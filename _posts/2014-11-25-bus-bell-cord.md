Imagine you are in a bus, you want to signal a stop and suddenly realize that there is **no
red button** to push. Red buttons are one of the few things that you expect to find in any bus
in any corner of the world, so you get a bit disappointed.

A few moments later you realize that instead of red buttons, travelers are using a **bus bell cord**.
I am not talking about a fancy old-style bell cord in a new and elegant bus like those in Manhattan:

And I am not even talking about an historical bus used as tourist attraction:

What I am talking about is just plain ordinary aged buses all around a city with such bell cords:
an old-style **purely mechanical system** to signal stops. As a matter of fact nowadays our society
tends to rely more on electronic systems rather than on purely mechanical systems.

Ok, so **where** do you expect it to be? Where do you think people still rely on a purely mechanical
system to signal stops when on a bus, like in the old times? Well, you probably don't know where,
but you know for sure that it's not in **Silicon Valley**, the homeland of the most advanced digital
technology, right? **Wrong**!! That's exactly there!

I actually love this: bell cords are inexpensive and probably require less maintenance than any other
electronic device. But for sure, I would not expect to see them in Silicon Valley!
