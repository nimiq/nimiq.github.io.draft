I will take part in
[Google Summer of Code 2014](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1)!!
I submitted a
[proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yBkXf29MP_Hjc7G7Ayd30iL6z7-1aLA53j7ezLQuPXk/edit?usp=sharing)
for the [NeuroStars]({{ site.baseurl }}/neurostars/) project and I got selected!

The proposal is not exactly the plan of the activities we'll be doing, but only a rough idea of
what we could do.

A more detailed plan will be made in the coming months together with my mentors *Roman* and
*Satrajit* and checked with *Istvan*, author of
[BioStar](https://github.com/ialbert/biostar-central/).
We will also ask the
[bioinformatics community](https://www.biostars.org/) for feedback.
