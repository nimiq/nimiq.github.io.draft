I met [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)! Well, actually it was just a
conference, but a very special one...

After attending [Google Summer of Code]({% post_url 2014-04-21-gsoc2014 %}) I got invited by Google
to attend the Google Summer of Code 10 year anniversary: 3 days of fun, activities, unconference
sessions and talks in San Jose, CA, USA.

Two big names, among others: Linus Torvalds and [Peter Norvig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig).
And two things stuck in my mind.

# <sup><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i></sup> Experience is overrated <sup><i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></sup>

Linus Torvalds was asked how he could write the Linux kernel when he was just a young inexperienced software engineer.
And that is how he replied: "Experience is somehow overrated..."

Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google, made fun of books like "Teach Yourself C++ in 10 Days".
He said it takes 10 years to deeply understand a programming language: in ten days or a month
or six months a Java developer f.i. could only learn C++ syntax and write Java-like code with C++ syntax.

So, learning a programming language is [a long process](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html)...
we'd better start early!
