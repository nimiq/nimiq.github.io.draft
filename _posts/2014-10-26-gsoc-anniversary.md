After [Google Summer of Code]({% post_url 2014-04-21-gsoc2014 %}) I got invited by Google
to attend the **Google Summer of Code 10 year anniversary** in San Jose, California: three days
of fun activities, unconference sessions and talks.

We went to [Great America](http://www.cagreatamerica.com) - actually Google reserved the entire
theme park exclusively for us!! - and to visit the [Google Plex]({% post_url 2014-10-26-google-plex %}).
But what impressed me the most is **FOSS people**.

# FOSS people
*Google Summer of Code* is a program meant to foster the
[Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) world
and thus the attendees of the 10 year anniversary event were techies involved in some FOSS project.
After chatting with many on them, I realized that FOSS people can be of two type, based on 
the nature of their motivation.

The *first type* of volunteers has a strong passion for **technology**. Their contribution to the FOSS world
is really precious, but their real motivation is the fervor for technology. You can easily
identify them because they hold a smart phone while talking and often wear Google Glass and some sort
of smart watch. They love having conversations about technology and in fact that's what
they do all the time!

The *second type* has a strong wish to contribute to the **common good**. They usually
believe that their daily job does not provide enough benefit to the society, they strongly want to be useful
and help the community and so they do what they are the best at: writing software for great open
source projects! Usually this type of person is open minded and very knowledgeable, he thinks
that technology is relevant, but it is just a tool like many other in our society.
This type amazes me. I remember in particular a guy, a philosopher, who I had breakfast with: he
said he studied in particular German philosophers in the 1900s. So, recalling my high school
studies, I asked him what *Heidegger* would think of modern technology. His answer was... well...
critical and... hard to understand, something like [this](https://belate.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/heidegger-modern-technology/)!!
