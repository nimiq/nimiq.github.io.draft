Bio
===
I grew up in *Italy*. After attending [one of the best science high schools](http://www.liceolussana.com)

I graduated with *top marks* and YES, *I am very proud of it*!

I lived in *Prague, Czech Republic* for a year during my [Erasmus Programme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme)

I am currently based in *Amsterdam, the Netherlands* where I learned to love bikes,
sliced bread and... rain!
