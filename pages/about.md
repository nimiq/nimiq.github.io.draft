Bio
===
I grew up in *Italy*. After one of the best [science high schools](http://www.liceolussana.com)
in town, I attended *Computer Engineering* at [University of Bergamo](http://www.unibg.it/).
I graduated with *top marks* and YES, *I am very proud of it*!

I lived in *Prague, Czech Republic* for a year during my [Erasmus Programme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme)
and loved their original [Pilsner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilsner_Urquell)
and [Svickova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sv%C3%AD%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1).

In 2013 I spent wonderful months in *Washington, DC, USA*
while attending [SPRINT](http://www.advanse.com/training/sprint-faqs/)
a summer program in international business.

I am currently based in *Amsterdam, the Netherlands* where I learned to love bikes,
sliced bread and, after a few years, even... the rain!
